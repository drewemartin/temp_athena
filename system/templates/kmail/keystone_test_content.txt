Keystone Testing Reminder

Arrival and estimated pick up times are as follows:

Please plan to arrive by %%start_time%%.  Please accompany your child into the building if you are transporting.  
Please plan to pick up at %%est_end_time%%.  
*Note that dismissal times are estimates.  These tests are untimed and your child's academic performance and safety must remain our top priority while present at a testing site. We appreciate your patience as we cannot provide a solid dismissal time and we must dismiss each child individually and check photo IDs.
